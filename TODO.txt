Immediate:
0. Implement approximation for highly overlapped inventory.
3. Add 'capacities' column to simulation report.
4. Run simulation of raw inventory with criteria, not matching sets
5. Move private availability to structured data base.
6. Add progress and warning massage to WatitForInventory.jsp
7. Kill load worker task on sign out.
8. Add avialability column allocation report.

Future (deploy in new instance):
1. Pull InventorySet into a library to share.
2. Pull utils into separate project.
3. Wait page for allocation.
4. Implement simulation with memchecked for speed.
5. Remove Main.jsp from url.

Long shot:
1. Dynamic inventory buildup.

Docs:
1. Add marketing section: targeting/direct/programmatic.
2. Explain overlapping inventory in more details.
3. Explain how it works with search/keyword ads.
4. Elaborate on how important it is for progammatic as by knowing availabilities in advance 
the advertizer can devlop better strategies and target creatives to most available audiences.
Also they can chose which audience segment to target at time frame when it is least expencieve.
