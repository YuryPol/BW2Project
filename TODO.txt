A. Code:
Immediate:
1. Remove Main.jsp from url.
2. Make wrong file diagnostics specific. 
3. Add 'capacities' column to simulation report.
4. Add simulation to allocation test.
5. Replace stored proc with queries.

Future (deploy in new instance):
0. Implement approximation for highly overlapped inventory.
1. Pull InventorySet into a library to share.
2. Pull utils into separate project.
3. Wait page for allocation.
4. Implement simulation with memchecked for speed.

Long shot:
1. Dynamic inventory buildup.


B. Docs:
1. Add marketing section: targeting/direct/programmatic.
2. Add data limitation for free version.
