A. Code:
Immediate:
1. Remove Main.jsp from url.
2. Make wrong file diagnostics specific. 
3. Add 'capacities' column to simulation report.
4. Add simulation to allocation test.
5. Add to check for inventory file size max overlap check.

Future (deploy in new instance):
0. Implement approximation for highly overlapped inventory.
1. Pull InventorySet into a library to share.
2. Pull utils into separate project.
3. Wait page for allocation.
4. Implement simulation with memchecked for speed.
5. Optimize structured inventory size for sets with no direct overlap.

Long shot:
1. Dynamic inventory buildup.


B. Docs:
1. Add marketing section: targeting/direct/programmatic.
2. Explain overlapping inventory in more details.
3. Specify errors in inventory file.
