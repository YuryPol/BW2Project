A. Code:
Immediate:
1. Remove Main.jsp from url.
2. Improve performance for SQL hogs:
	a) DELETE FROM structured_data_inc what is to be replaced (InventoryState.java:1021) up to 1 hour.
	b) the rest.

Future:
1. Pull InventorySet into a library to share.
2. Pull utils into separate project.
3. Wait page for allocation.

Long shot:
1. Dynamic inventory buildup.
